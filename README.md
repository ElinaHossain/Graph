# Graph

## What Does the Program Do?
This Java program implements a generic directed graph data structure. It allows users to create a graph, add vertices, establish weighted edges between vertices, and query various graph properties. The program also provides a method to visualize the graph by printing out vertices and their associated edges with weights.

## What I Learned:
- Implementation of a generic graph data structure in Java.
- Manipulation of vertices and edges in a graph.
- Handling graph-related operations such as checking for emptiness, fullness, vertex existence, and retrieving edge weights.
- Visual representation of a graph by printing its structure.

## How Could I Improve It?
- Graph Validation: Implement checks for valid inputs during vertex and edge addition (e.g., ensure vertices are unique).
- Exception Handling: Add proper exception handling for potential errors (e.g., index out of bounds, null references).
- File I/O: Include methods for reading a graph from a file or saving a graph to a file.
- Graph Visualization: Consider using a graph visualization library to create graphical representations of the graph.
- Testing: Develop comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness of each graph operation.
- User Interface (UI): Create a simple user interface for interacting with the graph, allowing users to add vertices and edges dynamically.
